  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 18, 2026</p>

  <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information in the mobile application “UGR8” (the “App”) for users in the United States.</p>

  <h2>Summary of Data Practices:</h2>
  <p>We collect only your birthday information to provide personalized insights within the App. This data is not linked to your identity, not used for tracking, stored locally on your device, and never shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
  <p><strong>A. Birthday Information:</strong> We collect only your birthday information to calculate and display personalized insights inside the App.</p>
  <p><strong>B. Information We Do NOT Collect:</strong> We do not collect or process your name, email address, payment information, health data, contacts, photos, microphone input, calendar, or any user-generated content. The App does not integrate any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics).</p>

  <h2>2. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>We use your birthday information to provide the App's core functionality: generating personalized insights for you. No other use is made, including for advertising, marketing, or tracking.</p>

  <h2>3. DATA SHARING & DISCLOSURE</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose your information to any third parties. Your data is stored locally on your iOS device; we do not maintain any server copy. If you enable iCloud backup, your data may be stored by Apple—please review Apple's Privacy Policy for details.</p>

  <h2>4. DATA EDITING & DELETION</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device. You may edit it at any time by navigating to App → Settings → Birth Info → "Save Birth Information". Any changes you make will update the data stored locally. Because we do not retain a server copy, modifying your data locally results in permanent deletion of the previous information.</p>
  <p>You may delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the App from your device.</p>
  
  <h2>5. DATA SECURITY</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable technical safeguards. As data resides on your device, we rely on iOS built-in encryption and security features. If you enable iCloud backup, data transmission is subject to Apple's security practices. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h2>
  <p>We do not intentionally transfer your data outside your region. However, if you use iCloud backup, Apple may store data in facilities outside your country, governed by its policies.</p>

  <h2>7. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
  <p><strong>All Users: </strong> You can manage your data directly in the App via Settings.</p>

  <h2>8. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we discover such data, we will promptly delete it. Parents or guardians with questions may contact us at <a href="mailto:Bio-Cosmo@outlook.com">Bio-Cosmo@outlook.com</a></p>

  <h2>9. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices. Material changes will be posted in the App with a new “Effective Date.” We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.</p>

  <h2>10. CONTACT US</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact us via email at:<a href="mailto:Bio-Cosmo@outlook.com">Bio-Cosmo@outlook.com</a></p>
