  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 18, 2026</p>

  <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE MOBILE APPLICATION “UGR8” (THE “APP”), YOU (“USER”) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE ("TERMS"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE APP.</p>

  <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
  <p>You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that organization.</p>  

  <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the App. If you are between 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction (typically 18 in the U.S.), you represent that you have reviewed these Terms with your parent or legal guardian and that they consent to your use. By using the App, you warrant that you meet these requirements.</p>

  <h2>3. ACCOUNT & SUBSCRIPTION</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A. Premium Subscription: The App offers a premium subscription for USD 4.99 per month (including applicable taxes) (“Subscription”), which is an auto-renewal subscription.</li>
    <li>B. Payment and Renewal: Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation. The Subscription automatically renews at the end of each billing period unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the period ends. Manage subscriptions via your iOS Settings → [Your Apple ID] → Subscriptions.</li>
    <li>C. Price Changes: We reserve the right to change subscription fees. Any price changes will be communicated to you in advance and will only apply to subsequent billing cycles with your consent as required by Apple's App Store policies.</li>
    <li>D. Refunds: All payments are processed by Apple. For refunds or billing issues, please contact Apple Support at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Support</a>. We do not process refunds directly, and all amounts paid are non-refundable by us, subject to Apple's policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
  <p>The App and all content, features, and software are owned by us or its licensors, protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works.</p>

  <h2>5. USER-GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
  <p>The App does not currently allow user submissions. If we add user-generated content features in the future, these Terms will be updated, and you may need to agree to additional guidelines.</p>

  <h2>6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.</p>

  <h2>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMIM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (E.G., LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS) ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, IF ANY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

  <h2>8. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION</h2>
  <p>Any dispute arising from these Terms or the App shall be resolved by binding, individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. This arbitration agreement precludes you from participating in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California. The arbitration proceedings may be conducted virtually, by video conference, or by other remote means at the discretion of the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary.</p>

  <h2>10. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes not subject to arbitration shall be brought in the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California.</p>

  <h2>11. CHANGES TO TERMS</h2>
  <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be posted in the App with an updated “Effective Date.” Your continued use after such changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>12. TERMINATION</h2>
  <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms, is harmful to others, or for any reason at our discretion. Upon termination, your rights under these Terms will cease.</p>
